# Certificates
This repository contains the Coursera specializations certificates that I have passed during my self-training in Machine Learning field. 

## [Big Data Specializaion](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/big-data)
This Specialization aims to understand big data and how it will impact your business. I gained an understanding of what insights big data can provide through hands-on experience with the tools and systems used by big data scientists and engineers. I have been guided through the basics of using Hadoop with MapReduce, Spark, Pig and Hive. By following along with provided code, I have experienced how one can perform predictive modeling and leverage graph analytics to model problems. This specialization prepared me to ask the right questions about data, communicate effectively with data scientists, and do basic exploration of large, complex datasets. In the final Capstone Project, developed in partnership with data software company Splunk, I applied the skills I learned to do basic analyses of big data.
## [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
The Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that helped me understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare me to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology. 

In this specialization, I was able to:
• Build and train deep neural networks, implement vectorized neural networks, identify architecture parameters, and apply DL to your applications
• Use best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building DL applications, use standard NN techniques, apply optimization algorithms, and implement a neural network in TensorFlow
• Use strategies for reducing errors in ML systems, understand complex ML settings, and apply end-to-end, transfer, and multi-task learning
• Build a Convolutional Neural Network, apply it to visual detection and recognition tasks, use neural style transfer to generate art, and apply these algorithms to image, video, and other 2D/3D data
• Build and train Recurrent Neural Networks and its variants (GRUs, LSTMs), apply RNNs to character-level language modeling, work with NLP and Word Embeddings, and use HuggingFace tokenizers and transformers to perform Named Entity Recognition and Question Answering
