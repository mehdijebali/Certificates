# Certificates
This repository contains the Coursera specializations certificates that I have passed during my self-training in Machine Learning field. 

## [Big Data Specializaion](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/big-data)
This Specialization aims to understand big data and how it will impact your business. I gained an understanding of what insights big data can provide through hands-on experience with the tools and systems used by big data scientists and engineers. I have been guided through the basics of using Hadoop with MapReduce, Spark, Pig and Hive. By following along with provided code, I have experienced how one can perform predictive modeling and leverage graph analytics to model problems. This specialization prepared me to ask the right questions about data, communicate effectively with data scientists, and do basic exploration of large, complex datasets. In the final Capstone Project, developed in partnership with data software company Splunk, I applied the skills I learned to do basic analyses of big data.
